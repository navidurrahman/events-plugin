With Events plugin, you can add and remove events from admin panel and frontend. I have created Events plugin with full calendar (Thanks to Adam Shaw http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/)
Installation:

Once you have downloaded the plugin, unzip and place the folder "events" into your plugins directory. Once you have done that, your pathing should be: /app/plugins/events/.

Setting up the URL routes

If you attempt to visit the plugin by going to the url yourdomain.com/events, you will receive a missing controller error. Do not worry; this is correct because the actual path is /events/index. Cake internally looks for a events controller first because of its URL routing system. To fix this you would add the following route to your routes.php, which in turn will route the URL /events correctly.

Router::connect('/events', array('plugin' => 'events', 'controller' => 'events', 'action' => 'index'));

Installing the necessary database tables

For the events to work, you will of course need to create the database table. You may find the database schema within the /events/vendors /events.sql. Once you have opened the events.sql, simply open your database, copy and paste the schema, and finally execute the SQL statements.

Customizing the events theme

You would need to edit the CSS style sheet located at /events/vendors/css/ or create your own from scratch. Additionally, you may edit the views to inject or remove HTML as you please.
